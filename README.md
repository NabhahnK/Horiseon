Horison is challenge one of my fullstack flex boot camp. I had to refactor an existing HTML and CSS code repository to achive mulitiple goals.

- semantic code
- logical structure
- alt attributes for images
- sequential heading elements
- descriptive title 

## Semantic Code

I needed to update the html code from older outdated methodology to the modern one.

### For example: 

From this:

```html
<div class="header">
```

To this:

```html
<header>
```
